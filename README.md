# Where's My Value?

This project contains a basic web crawler that runs from the command line. A separate UI will be built using shadcn components.

## Installation

Python 3.10 or newer is required. Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # downloads packages from PyPI
```

## Setup
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the values if needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` so your local settings remain private.

By default the API endpoint is configured as:

```bash
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## Running the CLI Crawler

Start the crawler interactively:

```bash
python wheres_my_value.py
```

The script prompts for configuration options. To keep track of visited pages, answer `y` when asked about history tracking. A file named `crawler_history.json` will be created and used on subsequent runs.

Choose `y` when prompted to export results in order to generate a timestamped text report after the crawl.

Example session:

```text
$ python wheres_my_value.py
Base URL: https://example.com
Search values (comma separated): contact, form
Track visited URL history? [y/N]: y
Export results to a file? [y/N]: y
```

## Running Tests

Execute the unit test suite with `pytest -q` for a concise summary of results:

```bash
pytest -q
```

## Running the Development Servers

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn api.server:app
```

The frontend code lives in the `ui` directory. If you have initialized a Next.js
project there, run its dev server from inside that folder:

```bash
cd ui
npm run dev
```


## Starting the Web Server

Run the API server and open the UI:

```bash
uvicorn api.server:app --reload
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to use the form interface.

An example configuration using the previous layout is available in
`examples/server.py`.


## Netlify Deployment
The repo includes `_headers` and `_redirects` for Netlify as well as a
`.env.example` to document build-time variables.

The **new** `netlify.toml` file controls the deployment. The configuration below
builds the Next.js frontend from the `ui/` directory, outputs to `ui/.next`, and
serves serverless functions from `netlify/functions/` using the official
Netlify Next.js plugin:

```toml
[build]
  base    = "ui"
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "ui/.next"

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
```

Deploy using the Netlify CLI or connect the repository through the Netlify web
UI. The FastAPI API is not automatically deployedâ€”convert it to serverless
functions or host it separately if you need API access in production. A simple
function in `netlify/functions/api.py` that adapts `api/server.py` might look
like this:

```python
from mangum import Mangum
from api.server import app

handler = Mangum(app)
```
